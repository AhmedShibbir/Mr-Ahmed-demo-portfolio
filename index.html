                <p>Hi there, what do you want?</p>
                <p>This is Mr. Ahmed to help you. The New York Daily News, officially titled the Daily News, is an American newspaper based in New York City. It was founded in 1919 by Joseph Medill Patterson as the Illustrated Daily News. It was the first U.S. daily printed in tabloid format. It reached its peak circulation in 1947, at 2.4 million copies a day.</p> 
                <p>One of the reasons that flexbox quickly caught the interest of web developers is that it brought proper alignment capabilities to the web for the first time. It enabled proper vertical alignment, so we can at last easily center a box. In this guide, we will take a thorough look at how the alignment and justification properties work in Flexbox.
                    To center our box we use the align-items property to align our item on the cross axis, which in this case is the block axis running vertically. We use justify-content to align the item on the main axis, which in this case the inline axis running horizontally.</p>
